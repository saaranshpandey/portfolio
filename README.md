## Hi there! üëã

I‚Äôm Saaransh Pandey, a grad student at the University of Pennsylvania and currently working as a Lead Data Scientist at Aeronautical Systems Incorporated (ASI). With over four years of industry experience in data science and software development, I‚Äôm passionate about leveraging data and machine learning to tackle complex real-world challenges. I love experimenting with AI to drive innovation, especially in fields like healthcare and defense.

Feel free to explore my journey and check out some of the cool projects I‚Äôve worked on!

### üöÄ Current Role

- **Lead Data Scientist @ Aeronautical Systems Incorporated (ASI)**  
  _Jun 2024 - Present_  
  At ASI, I‚Äôve led a talented team of interns during the summer to develop AI-driven tools designed to assist Logistics Information Technologies (LIT) customers. These tools automate processes that were previously manual and time-consuming, significantly reducing processing times. Some of the highlights include:
  - A **Competition Score Predictor**, providing actionable insights for customers to detect competitors and make strategic bids, saving hours of manual research. This was built using Python and deployed via Azure ML endpoints.
  - A **Similar NSNs Identification Tool**, which helps find alternatives to unavailable products or justify pricing, leveraging Pinecone and Azure ML.
  - A **Manufacturer and Distributor Predictor**, using LLMs to extract and clarify ambiguous supplier information, streamlining the identification process for customers.

### üíº Previous Experience

- **Lead Data Scientist @ UnitedHealth Group (Optum)**  
  _Oct 2022 - Jul 2023_  
  Worked on a **machine learning model** to detect early signs of opioid addiction, which achieved impressive recall and specificity. I also automated data validation workflows using **Python** and **SQL**, reducing turnaround times significantly for large-scale healthcare data management.

- **Software Engineer @ UnitedHealth Group (Optum)**  
  _Jul 2020 - Sep 2022_  
  Automated several processes including facility and physician databases, improving data accuracy and reporting. I also built a **Power BI dashboard** that enhanced visibility for key stakeholders in healthcare management.

### üß† Projects I‚Äôve Loved Working On

- **Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
  _Mar 2024 - May 2024_  
  Tackled a class imbalance problem in a massive dataset of 24 million rows with **Python** and **XGBoost**, achieving a recall score of 0.86 and ROC AUC of 0.96. Fraud detection never looked this good!

- **Image Classification with Deep Learning**  
  _Aug 2023 ‚Äì Dec 2023_  
  Worked with **CNNs** on the CIFAR-10 dataset, increasing accuracy from 70.99% to 80.13%. Did some cool data augmentation and regularization to get there. Also played around with dataset shifts to see how resilient our models were.

- **Brewery Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  _Jan 2024 - Mar 2024_  
  Fun with beer! üçª I ran exploratory data analysis (EDA) on brewery data using **Python** and **Spark SQL** to understand trends in alcohol content and SKU distributions.

### üõ† Skills & Tools

I work across a variety of tools and platforms:

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Java, C++
- **Machine Learning & Data Analysis**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, PySpark, Kaggle
- **Cloud & Big Data**: Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery
- **Visualization & BI**: Power BI, JMP, Matplotlib
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter, OpenCV, GNU Radio, COMSOL

### üåü Publications

I‚Äôve also had the opportunity to work on some exciting research:

1. [Numerical modeling & analysis of chalcogenide-based step-index optical fiber](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214785320302108) ‚Äì *Published in Elsevier, 2020.*
2. [Visible Light Communication Modulation Toolkit](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9118103) ‚Äì *Published in IEEE, 2019.*
